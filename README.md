Early Prototype — Vision & Roadmap
# SkateLite — Tricks, Grinds & Combos
SkateLite is a fast, arcade-style 2D platformer where the goal is to pull off the coolest tricks, chain massive combo multipliers, and progress through themed areas. This is a development roadmap description — gameplay features below outline what the game will become.

### Tricks & Combos
Learn and upgrade tricks (kickflip, manuals, grinds). Link them into combos to multiply your score.

### Skateshop & Upgrades
Buy upgrades and items in the skateshop at the area end — stack multipliers and tailor your build.

### Score & Progression
Hit target points to unlock the next area. Design your runs to maximize multipliers and style.

### Lobby & Quests
Unlock NPCs in the lobby to accept quests — complete them for cosmetics and board upgrades.

### Controls (Prototype)
- Left / Right — Move
- Up — Jump
- Down + Jump — Grind / Drop
- Action — Trick / Spin
- Hold Action — Charge special trick
